    "## Problem 1 (Contact tracing with Asymptomatic Transmissions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an infectious disease in which some individuals may transmit to their contacts even without showing symptoms.  There are two scenarios we will consider that can cause this.  You **have your choice of which scenario** to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **scenario 1** After becoming infected, individuals have an incubation period (E) prior to becoming symptomatic (I).  In that incubation period, they may be infectious.  After becoming symptomatic, they remain infectious until they recover (R) or are identified (T).  So without any intervention the transitions are S->E->I->R.  Symptomatic (I) individuals enter the additional traced/identified \"T\" class either because of their symptoms, or because an infected neighbor was identified and they were then traced.  The incubating individuals (E) can enter the traced/identified class (T) only by contact tracing from an identified neighbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **scenario 2** After becoming infected, some individuals have a completely asymptomatic infection, while others are symptomatic.  Both may be infectious.  The symptomatic individuals (I_s) behave like the 'I' individuals above, and the asymptomatic individuals (I_a) behave like the 'E' individuals above.  The transitions here are S -> I_s -> R and S -> I_a -> R in absence of intervention.  With interventions I_s nodes are identified because of symptoms or because of contact tracing.  The I_a nodes are identified only through contact tracing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to know how well contact tracing works in these populations.  In both cases, individuals that have been identified are removed from the population (so they stop transmitting).  For each identified node, there is a period over which its infected neighbors may be identified.  During this period, the symptomatic and asymptomatic neighbors are found with some rate (per edge).  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to simulate epidemics with these properties on various types of networks and write up a report to provide policy recommendations.  The code below will do the simulations.  This will not be as fast as some of the simulations we've used already, so don't be surprised if you need to use smaller networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please explore a range of networks, including Watts-Strogatz and Configuration Model networks.   Also explore various parameters.  Report on \n",
    "- the impact of tracing compared to just isolating symptomatic individuals \n",
    "- under which conditions it would be better to invest resources in more efficient tracing versus more efficient identification of symptomatic individuals. \n",
    "- What network structures are more or less amenable to these control measures\n",
    "- What assumptions are made that may limit the predictions you come up with.\n",

    "<span style = 'color:red'> Note that we've discovered a bug if a node has an edge to itself, which can happen in Configuration Model networks.  This can be corrected with the following command right after `G` is defined: `G.remove_edges_from(list(G.selfloop_edges()))` </span>"

A node will adopt 'a' (or 'b') if the number of those who agree with it on issue 1 who believe 'a' plus the number who disagree on issue ~~2~~ <span style=\"color:red\">1</span> who believe 'b' crosses $r$.  As before, you'll need some form of tiebreaker.\n",
