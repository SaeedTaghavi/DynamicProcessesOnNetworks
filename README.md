# DynamicProcessesOnNetworks

These are the jupyter notebooks used for my AMSI summer school course on Dynamic Processes Spreading in Complex Networks.

Most of these notes were written on the fly while I was lecturing 7 hours a week.  So there are likely to be small issues either in presentation or in the description.  But I think the code I wrote is in good shape.  If you see any issues, please report them (see the issues link at the top of the github page).
